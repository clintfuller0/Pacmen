# Pacmen
## This project focused on interaction with the DOM, utilizing arrays, random values, x + y positions/velocities, and recognizing and avoiding borders in order to make the Pacmen bounce around without going off-screen. In order to run, you will have to first add Pacmen to the screen by clicking the "Add PacMan" button. Once the desired number has been reached, clicking the "Start Game" button will send them all on their way. In the future, I'd like to add in various sizes of Pacman and have then move around at varying velocities.
